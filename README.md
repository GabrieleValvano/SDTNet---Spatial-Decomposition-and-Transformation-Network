# Spatial Decomposition and Transformation Network (SDTNet)

**Tensorflow implementation of SDTNet**

Code (will be out soon!) for reproducing results in the paper:

> Valvano, G., Chartsias, A., Leo, A., & Tsaftaris, S. A.,  
> *Temporal Consistency Objectives Regularize the Learning of Disentangled Representations*, MICCAI Workshop on Domain Adaptation and Representation Transfer, 2019.
 
The overall block diagram of the SDTNet is the following:
